                            <br> Established in 2007, the <a href="http://education.jhu.edu/" target="_blank">School of Education (SOE) at the Johns Hopkins University</a> has quickly taken its place as a national leader in education reform through research and teaching. Grounded in the Johns Hopkins tradition of research and innovation, SOE currently receives more funded research than any other graduate school of education in the United States.
                            <br>
                            <br> The <a href="http://www.tdschools.org/" target="_blank">Talent Development Secondary</a> has been a partner for change in hundreds of schools in cities, suburbs, and rural areas across the country. During the 2014-15 school year, we worked with 54 schools serving nearly 50,000 students, with 23 high schools and 31 middle schools in 14 states and the District of Columbia.
